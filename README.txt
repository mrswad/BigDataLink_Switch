First of all, we apologise for the delay.

	Starting off, the project itself was supposed to be held on one of our own computers,
supposing that we had to do a presentation of some sort, therefore it is only locally-hosted.
The code does work, but it needs some minor changes depending on the user's computer,
such as the location of the database and where imagines in the website are stored.
	Besides this, another important thing that we feel must be added, is that the
code only works when the files (from the github you have provided us) are in the same folder.
We have only called the functions of the "ingestion" part once, and therefore the calling is
not present in the code, but we are more than eager to explain how we did it and why.

	The project is split into the, ingestion, processing, and finally reporting the data
which is actually done through a locally-hosted website using Flask. 
	The rest of the documentation is explained thoroughly ( as thoroughly as 5 pages allowed
us) on the report we have sent you.
